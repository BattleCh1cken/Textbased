Pygame has been deleted due to pygame != python. Think of it like java != javascript, you have to make a new pygame replit to run pygame. If you run pygame on this replit, it will return
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 12, in <module>
    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
pygame.error: No available video device
```
I don't reccomended try to do pygame cuz that is more display then actual math and stuff. It is a hell to fix bugs if you are not good with class, def and refreshing(```replit.clear()``` and other replit system stuff **(don't import sys it don't exist)**).

```python 
import turtle
