# Welcome to Testbased !!!
#### Explore the function that the game currently has by look at the files. Completed/Usable code have the first letter in the words capitalize. recommended you go to leetcode.com and do the easy problem to get a sense of how to write def functions and other code.
---
Changable things are in <>, the code will crash if you dont change it
### Code for testing runtime...
```python
import time
start_time = time.time()
'''
Insert Code Here
'''
print("Runtime: ",(time.time() - start_time),"seconds")
```
### Clearing Console:
```python
import replit
#call the following to clear
replit.clear()
```

### Easy def function (insert and run)
```python
def <calling> (<input_a>:<typing_a> , <input_b>:<typing_b>)-> <typing_c>:
  #Insert Code Here
  return <variable_with_typing_c>
```

### Looping Testing (Paste after code)
```python
tryagain=""
while tryagain != "stop":
  #print(<calling_function> (<input_a> , <input_b>))
  tryagain = input("Type 'stop' to stop  ")
```

### Questions: (Just paste code/things that you don't understand)

# Rules
```
1. Runnng Code
-You run the files by renaming the file into 'main.py' or
-python <path to file you want to run>
- Make sure to make a copy of the code then rename to main.py if you want to run the code
- File name will be included within ''' ''' and is yellow

2. Comments and questions
- Type "#" to write comments in the code(it will be green) to help keep track of what you are coding
- if you have any questions/comments about the code, use the chat function on the bottom right
- make sure to write filename and line number if applyable

3. Organized Files
- GameFiles have _ as spaces
- RandomStuff is for the random stuff that you can test
- ToDoList has files that you can test and captialize name if you are done
- List the inputs and output in lines 2-3
- Make sure to put that information of the function in orange(''' ''')
