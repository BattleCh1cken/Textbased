# Game design ideas: 
(finding a good planning website,plz reccommend)
- Screen is going to look at that oregon trails with the background being twice as slow as the ground to simulate movement across places
- Right side is the character and left side is the town/place/building that the player will encounter
- do the hokie pokie
