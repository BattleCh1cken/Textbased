Think of TwoSum as a riddle!
Inputs: list:[2,10,4,5,6,9,8]  target:18
- How do you get the computer to select the two numbers that add up to the target number?
- Is there anyway you can go through the list to find the other number?
- How would you keep track of the index of the numbers

Key concepts to know:
- for loops
- len()
- if and esle statements
- Finding the value at index(x) in the list

If you still have no idea how to do TwoSum I reccomend subtracting each number in the list by the target and seeing if the difference is in the list or not.
For example:

'''
print("/give @kevin diamond_armor[enchantment: super_bulletproof, unbreaking X, protection X] ")
#Jimmy I appreciate the fact that your making a coding tutorial during a lockdown
#Jimmy are you sacrificing your fellow students for your survival?
#dude jimmy I think something happened close to the school like a shooting
# But elementary school don't have police with gun and taser walking arround in the school
print("kevin receives enchanted diamond armor")
